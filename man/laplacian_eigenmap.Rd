\title{Laplacian eigenmaps}
\usage{
laplacian_eigenmap(W, measure_type = c("unorm", "norm"), p = 2,
  eig_tol = 1e-10)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{The weighted graph adjacency matrix}

\item{measure_type}{Type of laplacian eigenmap (norm for normalised, unorm otherwise)}

\item{p}{Dimension of the embedded space, default is 2}

\item{eig_tol}{The value below which an eigenvalue is deemed to be 0. Ideally these would all
be \code{.Machine$double.eps} but numerical instabilities mean they are often larger. A good
cutoff seems to be around 1e-10. If more than one zero eigenvalue is found but this is inconsistent
with the number of connected clusters then the user will be warned to adjust eig_tol.}
}
\value{
A list containing two entries:
\itemize{
\item{\code{embedding}}{A \code{p} by \code{nrow(W)} matrix with the laplacian eigenmaps embedding}
\item{\code{connected_components}}{A vector of length \code{nrow(W)} of integers specifying to which
connected component each cell belongs}
}
}
\description{
Construct a laplacian eigenmap embedding
}
\examples{
## create synthetic weight matrix
W <- matrix(sample(0:1, 25, replace = TRUE), nrow=5)
diag(W) <- 0 ; W <- 0.5*(W + t(W))
le <- laplacian_eigenmap(W) # returns a list with entries embedding and connected_components
}
