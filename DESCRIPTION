Title: Laplacian eigenmaps & principal curves for pseudotemporal ordering of single-cell RNA-seq data
Description: Cells sequenced using RNA-seq are invariably at different stages of progression through a diverse range of biological processes. Embeddr uses the laplacian eigenmap algorithm to perform a non-linear dimensionality reduction of the scRNA-seq data before using principal curves to trace through the centre of the manifold and assign a 'pseudotime' to each cell. A range of functions for differential expression is also included.
